# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## Project Shape

`openwakeword_go` is a pre-1.0 native Go implementation of the openWakeWord
inference pipeline. The main module is the library. The microphone demo lives in
`examples/microphone` as a separate Go module so the library does not depend on
PortAudio.

Main library files:

- `shared.go`: public audio constants and `Samples`.
- `audio_features.go`: mel-spectrogram and embedding feature extraction.
- `model.go`: wake-word model options and internal model state.
- `engine.go`: streaming engine and prediction orchestration.
- `vad.go`: stateful Silero VAD wrapper.
- `onnx.go`: private ONNX Runtime adapter.
- `wav.go`: WAV decoding and clip prediction helpers.

Local model and runtime assets live under `models/` and `runtime/`. They are
ignored by git and must not be committed.

## Commands

Run these from the repository root:

```bash
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```

The microphone example has its own module:

```bash
cd examples/microphone
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```

In sandboxed environments where the default Go cache is not writable, use a
local cache and remove it afterwards:

```bash
mkdir -p .gocache
GOCACHE="$PWD/.gocache" go test ./...
GOCACHE="$PWD/.gocache" go vet ./...
rm -rf .gocache
```

Run the opt-in integration test only when local runtime and model files are
available:

```bash
ONNXRUNTIME_SHARED_LIBRARY_PATH=runtime/libonnxruntime.dylib \
OPENWAKEWORD_MODEL_DIR=models \
go test -run TestOfficialONNXModels -v
```

Use the platform-specific ONNX Runtime filename when not on macOS.

## API And Design Conventions

- Public audio input is `Samples`, a mono `[]float32` PCM stream normalized to
  roughly `[-1, 1]`.
- `SampleRate` is fixed at 16 kHz and `FrameSamples` is fixed at 1280 samples.
- Keep the public API small for v0.x. Do not reintroduce audio filters,
  verifiers, or multiclass mappings unless there is a concrete use case.
- `AudioFeatures`, `VAD`, and `Engine` own ONNX sessions and must be closed.
- VAD is stateful. Use separate VAD instances for unrelated streams or
  workflows.
- Keep ONNX-specific tensor lifecycle code inside `onnx.go` where possible.
- The main module should not depend on PortAudio. Keep microphone-only code in
  `examples/microphone`.

## Error And Documentation Style

- Use lower-case error messages unless they begin with an identifier or acronym
  that is normally capitalized.
- Add context when wrapping errors, for example `load wake-word model %q: %w`.
- Keep comments short and technical. Add GoDoc for exported API; avoid comments
  that merely repeat the function name.

## Release Hygiene

- Do not commit generated caches, ONNX model files, native runtime binaries, or
  IDE files.
- Keep `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` aligned with public API changes.
- Before release, run root tests/vet, example tests/vet, and the opt-in
  integration test when local assets are available.
